Based on the following information, create a search query for the Tavily API. The search query should be a natural, human-like question. For example, instead of "automobile industry," it should be "What are the current trends in the automobile industry?"

User request:
{task}

Previous refined_query:
{refined_query}

Previous score:
{previous_score}

If refined_query is not empty and the previous score was below 0.6, it means the previous search returned unreliable information. Improve the query accordingly. If refined_query is empty or the previous score was 0.6 or higher, treat it as an initial request.

Example:

Task: "Find out about the trends in the automobile industry"
Refined query: ""
Previous score:
Search query: What are the recent trends in the automobile industry?

Task: "Learn about the latest trends in the IT industry"
Refined query: What are the recent trends in the IT industry?
Previous score: 0.4
Search query: Can you provide reliable information on the latest trends in the IT industry?

Generate only the search query.
